Customer Segmentation and Lookalike Model - Data Science Project
Overview
This project is focused on analyzing eCommerce customer data to develop a Lookalike Model and perform Customer Segmentation using clustering techniques. The goal is to create actionable insights to help businesses target customers more effectively. The project utilizes Python for data processing, modeling, and analysis, with tools such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

Project Phases
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this phase, we explore the dataset to understand the features, identify missing values, and check for patterns. The goal is to prepare the data for further analysis and model building.

2. Lookalike Model
The Lookalike Model identifies customers who resemble the top-performing customers. We use a combination of Cosine Similarity and KMeans Clustering to identify lookalike segments.

Key Outputs:

Lookalike results saved in lookalike_results.csv
Visualizations of the top-performing customer segments
3. Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
In this phase, we apply KMeans clustering to segment customers based on various attributes (e.g., spending behavior, demographics). The optimal number of clusters is determined through experimentation, and the results are evaluated using metrics like the Davies-Bouldin Index.

Key Outputs:

Cluster assignments saved in clustering_results.csv
Visualizations of customer segments (using PCA for dimensionality reduction)
4. Final Submission
After completing all phases, the notebooks, output CSVs, and other files are organized for submission. These results are uploaded to GitHub as a public repository for access and sharing.
